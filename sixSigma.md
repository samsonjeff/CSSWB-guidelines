## what is Six Sigma

-The ultimate goal of Six Sigma is to attain a process with no more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities.

-Reason Why Implemented : to identify the real root causes of the problems

Systematic, Disciplined, costumer focused, data driven or process to reduce DELAY, DEFECTS & VARIATIONS that uses DMAIC.

## Six Sigma Equation (The heart of 6 Sigma)
-Y = f (x1, x2, x3, Xnâ€¦)
Y is for dependent variable or the Process, Except Y is the Inputs + Process Steps

## S I P O C
-Suppliers -Inputs -Process -Outputs -Customers

-1st Process to map out the process from top going down
-2nd Inputs to identify all the inputs needed to do to do the step
-3rd Suppliers identify the suppliers where to get the input
-4th Outputs identify all of the output after completing the process step
-5th Customers identify the recipients that generated by the process step 

## DMAIC METHODOLGY
-Define : the project
-Measure : the current situation
-Analyze : to identify cause
-Improve : by implementing solutions and evaluating results
-Control : by standardizing

## Average and Standard Deviation

-Standard Deviation is a measure of consistency: the spread of data with respect to mean (average)

## COPQ - the number one enemy of Lean Six Sigma, that can results to Cash Leaks
-COPQ - Cost Of Poor Quality
 effects:
	-Process Defects
	-Process Delays
	-Process Variations
## W I P (Work In Progress)

## Y is the project
there are only two type of project in six sigma:
-Process defects (reduction)
-Processing time (reduction)

## CSS(Category of Six Sigma or Belt)
