** What is Six Sigma
Systematic, Disciplined, customer focused, data driven or process to reduce DELAY, DEFECTS & VARIATIONS that uses DMAIC.

- The ultimate goal of Six Sigma is to attain a process with no more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities.
- Reason Why Implemented : to identify the real root causes of the problems

** Six Sigma Equation (The heart of 6 Sigma)
- Y = f (x1, x2, x3, Xnâ€¦)
  Y is for dependent variable or the Output, Except Y is the Inputs + Process Steps

** S I P O C
- Suppliers
  - 3rd Suppliers identify the suppliers where to get the input
- Inputs
  - 2nd Inputs to identify all the inputs needed to do the step
- Process 
  - 1st Process to map out the process from top going down
- Outputs
  - 4th Outputs identify all of the output after completing the process step
- Customers
  - 5th Customers identify the recipients that generated by the process step 

** DMAIC METHODOLOGY
- Define : the project
- Measure : the current situation
- Analyze : to identify cause
- Improve : by implementing solutions and evaluating results
- Control : by standardizing

** Average and Standard Deviation
- Standard Deviation is a measure of consistency: the spread of data with respect to mean (average)

** COPQ - the number one enemy of Lean Six Sigma, that can result to Cash Leaks
- COPQ - Cost Of Poor Quality
  effects:
  - Process Defects
  - Process Delays
  - Process Variations

** W I P (Work In Progress)

** Y is the project
There are only two types of project in six sigma:
- Process defects (reduction)
- Processing time (reduction)

** CSS (Category of Six Sigma or Belt)
The higher the belt the more proficiency you are
- CSSWB white
