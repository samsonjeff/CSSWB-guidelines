** Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of this short course, you will:
- Understand the **fundamentals of Six Sigma** and its role in improving business processes.
- Learn how to **analyze and reduce defects, delays, and variations** in service operations.
- Gain practical knowledge of the **DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)**.
- Identify **root causes of quality problems** using data-driven decision-making.
- Recognize how to apply Six Sigma tools in **real-world service environments**.
- Be prepared for higher Six Sigma certifications (Yellow, Green, and Black Belt).

** What is Six Sigma
Systematic, Disciplined, customer-focused, and data-driven process to reduce **DELAY, DEFECTS & VARIATIONS** using the **DMAIC** method.

- The ultimate goal of Six Sigma is to attain a process with no more than **3.4 defects per million opportunities**.
- Implemented to **identify the real root causes** of problems and improve efficiency.

** Six Sigma Equation (The heart of 6 Sigma)
- Y = f (x1, x2, x3, Xn…)
  - *Y* is the dependent variable (Output)
  - *X* represents the Inputs and Process Steps that affect *Y*

** S I P O C Framework
A structured way to analyze a process from start to finish:
- **Suppliers** → Identify where to get inputs  
- **Inputs** → List all materials/data needed  
- **Process** → Map the steps from start to finish  
- **Outputs** → Determine the results produced  
- **Customers** → Identify recipients of the process outcome

** DMAIC METHODOLOGY
The core method of Lean Six Sigma:
- **Define** : Identify the project and goals  
- **Measure** : Assess current performance  
- **Analyze** : Find the root causes of issues  
- **Improve** : Implement and test solutions  
- **Control** : Standardize and sustain improvements  

** Average and Standard Deviation
- **Standard Deviation** measures **consistency** — the spread of data around the mean (average).
- Low deviation means a **more stable process**.

** COPQ (Cost Of Poor Quality)
The number one enemy of Lean Six Sigma, leading to **cash leaks**.

Effects include:
- Process Defects  
- Process Delays  
- Process Variations  

** W I P (Work In Progress)
Refers to items currently being processed — reducing WIP helps improve efficiency.

** Y is the Project
Two main types of Six Sigma projects:
- **Process Defects Reduction**
- **Processing Time Reduction**

** CSS (Category of Six Sigma or Belt)
The hierarchy of Six Sigma certifications:
- CSSWB – White Belt  
- CSSYB – Yellow Belt  
- CSSGB – Green Belt  
- CSSBB – Black Belt  
- MBB – Master Black Belt  

** Why are Six Sigma Trainings Expensive?
- Highly specialized practice
- Globally recognized and **highly valued by companies**
